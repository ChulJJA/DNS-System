# DNS-System
 It is a simple protocol mimicking the Domain Name System (DNS).
 Built a set of DNS resolvers with private databases and a client program that resolves queries
 against this (distributed and hierarchical) database. There are 4 programs in this project.
 A client, a root DNS server (RS), and two top-level domain servers (TS1 and TS2). Based on
 this simple DNS system, I have implemented iterative and recursive query resolution.
